.SYNOPSIS
    Deploy Hybrid LLM Router infrastructure using Azure Developer CLI (azd)

.DESCRIPTION
    This script deploys the Hybrid LLM Router infrastructure using Azure Developer CLI (azd).
    It provides a modern, streamlined deployment experience compared to traditional az cli.

.PARAMETER EnvironmentName
    The environment name to deploy to (e.g., dev, test, prod). Defaults to 'dev'

.PARAMETER Location
    The Azure region to deploy to. Defaults to 'eastus2'

.PARAMETER AdminEmail
    Admin email for API Management service. Defaults to current user

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Run in what-if mode to see what would be deployed without actually deploying

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip confirmation prompts and deploy immediately

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-azd.ps1
    Deploy to dev environment with default settings

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-azd.ps1 -EnvironmentName "prod" -Location "westus2" -AdminEmail "admin@company.com"
    Deploy to production environment in West US 2

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-azd.ps1 -WhatIf
    Preview what would be deployed without actually deploying
