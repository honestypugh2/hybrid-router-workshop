    "# Lab 4 (Alternate): BERT-Based Model Routing with mobileBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** In this alternate approach to Lab 4, we will replace the heuristic routing logic with a **BERT-based classifier** that predicts whether a user query should be handled by the **local** or **cloud** model. We will fine-tune a lightweight BERT variant (MobileBERT) on example queries labeled as \"local\" or \"cloud\". This classifier will then drive the routing decision in our chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why mobileBERT?** MobileBERT is a compact, efficient version of BERT designed for on-device applications. It offers faster inference and lower memory usage, making it suitable for running alongside our on-device LLM to decide routing in real time. By training a classifier, we allow the router to learn nuanced patterns beyond simple rules (e.g., certain keywords or lengths), potentially improving its accuracy as we gather more training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of ML-Based Routing:\n",
    "- 🧠 **Learns nuanced patterns** beyond simple rules\n",
    "- 📊 **Data-driven decisions** that improve with more training data\n",
    "- 🔄 **Adaptable and scalable** as usage patterns evolve\n",
    "- ⚡ **Efficient inference** suitable for real-time routing"
