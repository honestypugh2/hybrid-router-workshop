    "# Lab 4 (Alternative): Phi SLM-based Model Routing Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement an intelligent SLM-based query router using a fine-tuned Phi model that automatically decides whether to send queries to the local model or Azure cloud model based on learned patterns from domain-specific training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll:\n",
    "- Use a fine-tuned Phi Small Language Model (SLM) for query classification\n",
    "- Load the trained Phi router for intelligent routing decisions\n",
    "- Compare Phi SLM-based routing with rule-based and BERT approaches\n",
    "- Test routing accuracy with various query types\n",
    "- Create a unified interface that leverages SLM intelligence for routing\n",
    "- Build the foundation for our ML-powered hybrid chatbot system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Advantages of Phi SLM-based Routing:\n",
    "- **üß† Deep Language Understanding**: Phi models excel at instruction-following and natural language reasoning\n",
    "- **üéØ Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tuned specifically on query routing patterns\n",
    "- **üìà Scalable Performance**: Optimized for edge deployment while maintaining high accuracy\n",
    "- **üîç Context-Aware**: Understands nuanced complexity indicators in queries\n",
    "- **‚ö° Efficient Inference**: Small language model optimized for speed and resource efficiency\n",
    "- **üéì Transfer Learning**: Leverages Microsoft's pre-trained Phi capabilities"
