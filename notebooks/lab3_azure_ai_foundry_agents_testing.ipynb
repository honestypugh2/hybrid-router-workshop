    "# Lab 3 (Alternate): Azure AI Foundry Agents Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Learn how to use Azure AI Foundry Agents for sophisticated chat completion and agent-based interactions. This lab demonstrates how to leverage Azure AI Foundry's agent capabilities for more advanced conversational AI scenarios beyond simple chat completions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this alternate Lab 3, we'll:\n",
    "- Connect to Azure AI Foundry using the Agents SDK\n",
    "- Create and configure AI agents with specific capabilities\n",
    "- Test agent-based interactions for complex tasks\n",
    "- Compare agent performance with direct model calls\n",
    "- Understand when to use agents vs direct model access in our hybrid architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Azure AI Foundry Agents Benefits\n",
    "- **Structured Conversations**: Built-in conversation management\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Native support for function calling and tools\n",
    "- **State Management**: Automatic handling of conversation state\n",
    "- **Advanced Capabilities**: Multi-turn reasoning, planning, and execution"

    "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: HYBRID AI IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\n",
    "\n",
    "Our organization is evaluating the implementation of a hybrid AI architecture that combines \n",
    "on-premises local models with cloud-based AI services. This strategic initiative aims to \n",
    "optimize performance, cost, and data privacy while maximizing AI capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY BENEFITS:\n",
    "1. Performance Optimization: Local models provide sub-second response times for simple queries,\n",
    "   while cloud models handle complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "2. Cost Management: Reduces cloud API costs by routing simple requests locally.\n",
    "3. Data Privacy: Sensitive data can be processed locally without leaving the organization.\n",
    "4. Scalability: Cloud resources handle peak loads and complex workloads.\n",
    "5. Reliability: Local fallback ensures service continuity during network issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES:\n",
    "- Model Management: Maintaining and updating local models requires expertise.\n",
    "- Routing Logic: Intelligent decision-making for local vs cloud routing.\n",
    "- Infrastructure: On-premises hardware requirements and maintenance.\n",
    "- Integration: Seamless user experience across hybrid architecture.\n",
    "- Monitoring: Comprehensive observability across local and cloud components.\n",
    "\n",
    "FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS:\n",
    "Initial investment: $150,000 (hardware, software, training)\n",
    "Annual operational costs: $75,000\n",
    "Projected savings: $200,000 annually in cloud API costs\n",
    "ROI timeline: 12-18 months\n",
    "\n",
    "RECOMMENDATIONS:\n",
    "Proceed with pilot implementation focusing on customer service and document processing use cases.\n",
    "Establish success metrics and evaluation criteria before full deployment.\n",
    "Invest in team training and change management processes.\n",
